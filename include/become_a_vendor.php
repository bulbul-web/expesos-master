After trying to resolve it myself for 10 days with the seller, they stepped in and solved it in 5 minutes. Great staff and customer care. This is the first issue I’ve ever had and they resolved it so quickly. Thank you</p>

                                <h4>How do fees work on Xpesos?</h4>
                                <p>Joining and starting a shop on Xpesos is free. Product Listing is free, you only pay when you sell.</p>
                                <p>It does not cost you anything  to publish a listing to the marketplace. A listing lasts for four months or until the item is sold. Once an item sells, there is a 0% transaction fee on the sale price (including shipping costs). If you accept payments with PayPal, there may be payment processing fee based on their fee structure.</p>
